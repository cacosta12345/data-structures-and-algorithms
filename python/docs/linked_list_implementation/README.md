# Linked List Implementation
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
insert
    Arguments: value
    Returns: nothing
    Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
includes
    Arguments: value
    Returns: Boolean
    Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
to string
    Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I followed along with JB's lecture and wrote the same code.
