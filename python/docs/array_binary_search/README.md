Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->


Big O considerations:
Time: O(n)-- current index changed once for each item in the for loop
Space: O(n)-- one copy of each item in the original array was added the the result array and 1 value was added to the middle
